# System Info

Get up-to-date information about your computer resource usage on status bar.

## Features

* CPU utilization
* RAM usage

### Notes

Collecting CPU usage information involves running scripts (such as Powershell on Windows) that return information to the extension.

Why? Because I was not satisfied with the accuracy of the various solutions in Node.
Due to the solution I introduced, I `cannot` guarantee that this part of the extension will work flawlessly on `Linux` distributions and `MacOS`.

Please report any bugs or advice on the [repository](https://github.com/MASSHUU12/system-info/issues).

## Extension Settings

* `system-info.refreshRate`: Controls the refresh rate of information
